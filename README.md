**Fashion MNIST Classification**

**Overview**

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 clothing categories, such as T-shirts, shoes, and bags. The goal is to train a model to correctly identify these items.

**Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:

A computer with Python 3.8 or later installed.

pip (Python package manager) installed.

An internet connection (to install dependencies and download the dataset).

**Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone or Download the Project
If you have Git installed, clone the repository using:

git clone https://github.com/Ashipunaz/MultimediaWork.git


If you don't have Git, you can manually download the project as a ZIP file, extract it, and navigate to the project folder.

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
A virtual environment keeps dependencies organized:

python -m venv env

On Windows, activate it using:

env\Scripts\activate

On Mac/Linux, activate it using:

source env/bin/activate

Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Running the Model**

Ensure dependencies are installed (see installation steps above).

Run the notebook file to train the model:

python mnist_final.ipynb

The model will train, and you will see accuracy metrics displayed.

Sample predictions will be visualized using Matplotlib.

**Project Files**

mnist_final.ipynb - The main script for training and evaluating the model.

model_before_augmentation.keras - Saved model before augmentaions

model_after_augmentation.keras - Saved model after augmentations

requirements.txt - A list of required Python libraries.

README.md - This documentation file.

**Troubleshooting**

If using PyCharm and facing display issues with Matplotlib, add this to mnist_final.ipynb before importing matplotlib.pyplot:

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')

If you get a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure you installed dependencies correctly using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Additional Information**

Fashion MNIST is an alternative to the classic MNIST dataset but with clothing categories instead of handwritten digits.

The model uses CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), which are effective for image classification tasks.
